        <h1>The Mugging Story</h1>
        <p>
            On a cold day in February, I took a walk on the outskirts of my college campus on the way to dinner. Now, I was aware that this area had a seedy reputation, but being a second semester freshman, I only knew at most one way to get to any location I wanted to go. And this was the way I knew to dinner. So I stuffed my phone in my pocket and I started walking.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was dark enough at 6pm that you really couldn't see that far in front of you, and I could only tell that three people were walking toward me for a few moments. Once they were right in front of me, I could see that one had his hood up and one was wearing sunglasses.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Here we go," I remember thinking to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Give me your phone," the boy in front demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had no lock on my phone, so if I gave them my phone they'd have all my information.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I can't give you my phone, I'm sorry," I said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't make me cock this back."
        </p>
        <p>
            I looked down. There was a gun pointed at my stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
            In that moment, there is no explanation for what occurred except that the Holy Spirit was there. I should have crapped my pants, but I was completely calm. I knew what was going to happen before it did. I had no hesitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I looked back up to his eyes and said, "I can't give you my phone, I'm sorry."
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I believe for my muggers, this was an unexpected situation. The two guys without the gun were practically hiding behind their leader as they approached. But worse than any initial fears, they'd obviously found a crazy person - who doesn't change their answer when you point a gun at them??
        </p>
        <p>
            The lead guy faltered and we looked at each other for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you have any money?" he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes."
        </p>
        <p>
            I handed him $30 and they took off past me. That was it.
        </p>
        <p>
            A friend of mine was walking behind them, unaware of who they were or what they were doing. "What was that about?" she asked me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I explained the situation and we went to the campus public safety office to report the incident.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a Bible verse I want to share with you at this point.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to His purpose." -Romans 8:28
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            What does this verse mean? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, it doesn't mean that bad things don't happen. Unlike a cult leader, snake oil salesman, or politician, Jesus doesn't avoid telling us that there will be trouble. No, he promises that believers will encounter it, just like everyone else. But he also promises to be there, and to conquer that trouble.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "all things work together for good"
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            God can use even bad things to bring about beauty and joy and wonder. Even when someone, by their free will, goes against God's plan and causes incredible harm, there is a greater power at work to bring healing. God is present in every situation. Do not mistake the PRESENCE of bad things for the ABSENCE of God. He is still at work and he is still sovereign.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "for those who love God"
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            When you think about this, it's not a fair deal. We do the simple thing of giving God our imperfect and lowly hearts, and God works in every event in our life? His deal is recklessly biased in our favor, but this is the promise. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that I'm not saying that God will protect you from every misfortune, but that he will be with you through everything you experience, and that he will work on your behalf. It's not about having rewards, or protection, or even Heaven. It's about recognizing the love that is offered to you and genuinely choosing to reciprocate it. That is the greatest decision you can make in your entire lifetime.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "who are called according to His purpose"
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            And who is that? It's you! It's me. It's the great achievers and the kindest people in our world and it's the lowliest, most broken people too. You are called. You are wanted. You just have to respond.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now back to the story - did it really work out? Was it worth my $30??
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's some of the good that happened.
        </p>
        <h3>
            There was an outpouring of love and support.
        </h3>
        <p>
            My friend stuck with me the whole time I went to report the incident to make sure I was okay. Many school community members expressed concern, faculty and friends and told me how glad they were that I was okay. When I returned to my dorm room that night, some of my friends I was going to have dinner with were sitting on the floor of the hall, waiting for me. We spent the evening talking and laughing and appreciating the chance to be together.
        </p>
        <h3>
            I treated myself for trauma, to the shock of the school counselor.
        </h3>
        <p>
            I do not take it lightly what happened to me, nor did I at the time. It could have gone very differently if not for the protection God gave me. 24 hours after the mugging, I happened to see one of my professors in an academic building and I explained to him what had happened the night before. I just kind of blurted it out. Then I went to the top of the stairs, still in the academic building, and called home, questioned my safety, and cried. It turns out, this was normal - I was actually treating myself for trauma by talking through it. The school asked me to visit a counselor and, much to her surprise, she found that the work had already been done. It never bothered me again.
        </p>
        <h3>
            I got to help people.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Remember the friend who was walking behind the muggers? The semester before I was mugged, a girl was mugged by someone matching the same description in the same place - they hit her in the face with the gun. I don't know what would have happened if the muggers had found my friend instead of me, but I am glad I was there, because things went the way they did. After that, there was not another mugging of the same description on that street while I was at the school. Perhaps the occasion was jarring for them, or perhaps they just realized after my $30 that they really had very little to gain!
        </p>
        <h3>
            I got the chance to share my faith.
        </h3>
        <p>
            I got to tell other students, professors, the school counselor, and now you about this experience.
        </p>
        <h3>
            I was perfectly fine - in fact, my trust in the Holy Spirit was strengthened.
        </h3>
        <p>
            I'm going to be a little blunt here. If you think that God doesn't like to answer questions, you don't know anything about the Holy Spirit. While God doesn't answer every question, he does tell us a lot. This was not my first, or my last, occasion of knowing something I couldn't possibly know. Throughout my life, since my encounter with the Holy Spirit in my junior year of high school, and even before that, the Holy Spirit has guided me in ways that I wouldn't believe if I hadn't lived them myself. I'm not a strikingly brave or bold person - when I was young, my dentist told my parents I could never have orthodontics because I was too much of a coward. I did, by the way. It was terrifying. But the point is, I don't have to be perfect to be awesome. God fills in for us the places we are weak and allows us to do incredible things. Moses wasn't a great public speaker but he spoke to leaders and multitudes - and God. Sarah was old and barren, but she became the matriarch of an incredible number of descendants. David was a scrawny nobody, but he became a king.

        <blockquote>
            "Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong." 2 Corinthians 12:9-10
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Remember - you are loved, and you are called to his purpose. Will you follow?
