		<h1>The Necessity of You</h1>
		<h2>My Origin Story</h2>
		<p>
			My mom sat in the exam room and looked at her doctor expectantly.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What does that mean?" she asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Well, worst case scenario, your baby could be born brain-damaged."
		</p>
		<p>
			It was toxoplasmosis, a disease neither of my parents had even heard of before. But now it was in the room with them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The doctor went on. "I don't like to do this, but the State of New York requires that I ask right now what you want to do."
		</p>
		<p>
			To this day, my mom says she felt total peace and assurance in that moment. My father and mother looked at each other and replied, "Nothing."
		</p>
		<p>
			They took a chance on me, and did not have an abortion. It was the beginning of a fascinating life - I should know!
		</p>
		<p>
			My mom never had a day of morning sickness for her entire pregnancy, and she also never had a day without peace.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was born on an unseasonably cold day, under the height of a meteor shower. I was not brain-damaged; in fact, I had special gifts that quickly started to show themselves. I excelled in school, and in 7th grade decided that I wanted to be Valedictorian. I also decided that I would get a 100 average in English class for middle school and high school. I did both, and went on from there to go to a challenging engineering college where I graduated 0.1 off of Summa Cum Laude.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe it was all destiny. I was always meant to be born. I was always given the skills I needed when I needed them. But I'm not telling you this so that you can start working on a comic book of my life (though that wouldn't be unwelcome). I want to ask you if you feel this way about yourself. Do you know that you were meant to exist? Do you know that you are, and always have been, essential?
		</p>

		<h2>Your Origin Story</h2>
		<p>
			The best authority I know of on the nature of the soul is the Bible. God wrote to us concerning our origin and the environment of our creation. Here are a few of the things we find there:
		</p>
        <p>
        <em>
          "For You formed my inward parts; You knitted me together in my motherâ€™s womb. I praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are Your works; my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from You, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in Your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them." Psalm 139:13-16
        </em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>
				"Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: 'I am the Lord, who made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself.'" Isaiah 44:24
			</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>
				"Before I formed you in your mother's body I knew you. Before you were born I set you apart to serve me. I appointed you to be a prophet to the nations." Jeremiah 1:5
			</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Even though not every one of us will get to prophesy to nations, we are all called by God. Yes, even to be a prophet to others by sharing God's message of love.
		</p>
		<p>
			Maybe you know this; maybe you understand that your life is not your own and that your potential to bless the world around you is immense. But maybe you have doubts. This world can do that to you. You might be a little-noticed last child in a long line of exceptional siblings. Or you might not have grown up with the mother who carried you, and feel rather inept at what you feel called to do. Or maybe you've done some pretty horrible things and feel that the rest of your life can never make up for the damage you've already done. Well, you're not alone in these feelings - those are all experiences of people in the Bible! David was the youngest child, Moses was the adopted but self-doubting man, and Paul was the man with blood on his hands. God used them all. He made something of them, despite the way they might have felt about what they could do.
		</p>
		<p>
			So who are you?
		</p>
		<p>
			You're loved by God and important, that's who you are. I don't want you to doubt it.
		</p>
		<p>
			And I want you to help me tell the world the same. Given my origins, you probably are not surprised when I tell you that abortion troubles me. It probably troubles you too. I think most everyone agrees that there ought to be a better way - it shouldn't happen. I am very upset when I hear of lives being ended in the womb - from everything I can see in the verses above, and many others, those small beginnings already have souls, and dignity. And abortion challenges all of us to think about if our birth even mattered. What can we do? What do I want you to do?
		</p>
		<p>
			I want you to love yourself first. Just start with you. Not "oh, I do enough, I'm good enough" - that's not love. I mean I want you to have enough ammunition inside your being so that when you disappoint yourself massively, and nobody seems to want to talk to you, and you feel alone, and everything feels awful, you STILL can love yourself because God loves you and you have value. That's where I want to start. Because once you have that, you'll start to share it. You'll share life. You'll give it to other people.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the darkest times in my life, when I knew I should have done so much better, this is what got me through, and this is what I want you to have. I believe the rest will follow. When you truly start to understand the awe of your own existence, you will fight for other's too, without exceptions.
