			<h1>Is Reading the Bible Necessary?</h1>
			<p>
				I'll go straight to the answer here - no. God exists far beyond the pages of the Bible and you can start getting to know him wherever you are, no matter your circumstances.
			</p>
			<p>
				BUT
			</p>
			<p>
				Wanting to understand life and your existence and not reading the Bible is like wanting to cross the Atlantic fast and deliberately choosing a rowboat over an airplane. It makes no sense not to read the Bible!
			</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps you're reluctant to try to read the Bible - will it be boring, or difficult? At times it is both, yes. I've been trying to read Isaiah, and by the 30th chapter I was real tired about hearing prophesies against Israel's many neighbors with their difficult names. But the Bible can offer you more wisdom than any ordinary person could ever hope to discover independently. It's not the only way to learn about God - but it is a way to learn things you might otherwise never discover.
			</p>
			<h3>
				The Bible is useful for everything, and every part of the Bible is useful
			</h3>
			<p>
				In a letter to Timothy, who was just starting his career as a priest, the Apostle Paul wrote:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				I want to quickly point out that this does not mean that everything in the Bible is quoted directly from God, or that all the events recorded are agreeable to him. That's not what this means.
			</p>
			<p>
				It also doesn't mean we get to use the Bible to judge others. Anyone who tries to use the Bible to justify looking down on someone else didn't read it close enough. A Luke at look - er, a look at Luke 18:9 will make that abundantly clear.
			</p>
			<p>
				What it DOES mean is that every word in the Bible is useful. Reading any part of the Bible offers wisdom, even the wonky and tedious parts. It's all there for a reason. I believe that if you ask the Holy Spirit to help you understand why you're reading what you are, he will answer you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, this verse tells us that the Bible is an all-sufficient resource for anyone who wants to ANY good work. You cannot miss by reading the Bible - there's nothing it doesn't offer sufficient guidance for.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Knowing God outside the Bible
			</h3>
			<p>
				Personally, I recommend a two-prong approach to understanding God. Before, I mentioned that you could meet Jesus, achieve salvation, and have a relationship with God without ever reading the Bible, but that it's not a good idea to try that route.
			</p>
			<p>
				But a great thing you can do with that information is to try both! Getting to know God through events, creation, and people around you is an awesome way to learn about his character.
			</p>
			<p>
				Knowing God inside and outside the Bible lets you check your reading and your outside understanding against each other. When something in the Bible doesn't sound right when compared with the God you've met through prayer and the events of your own life, you can further investigate the translation or rethink how you are reading what's there. Alternately, reading the Bible can check interpretations of God that are too loose and are taking away the hard edges of Jesus' message. It's very tempting to forget about some of the more difficult parts of Jesus' message, but careful reading of the Bible will help you remember all of what he said - and how much he loves you when he says it.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Some Recommendations
			</h3>
			<p>
				If you're wondering where to start in the Bible, or just want a particularly good read, I would recommend (from my own meager readings),
				<ul>
					<li>
						Luke
						<p>
							Yes, maybe I did pick it because of Star Wars... But it was awesome! Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John are all great places to start in the Bible - the Gospels are clear, don't require you to know anything at all coming in to them, and tell you the most important story contained in the Bible or anywhere else: God loved us so much that his son died for our sins. And Jesus is so awesome to read about.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						James
						<p>
							Also a great first read in the Bible, it's short and clear, but thought-provoking. It's only a few pages long, but reading James could certainly change your life.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

				In a "red letter" Bible, words about the messiah and Jesus' words are printed in red. With a blended pop-country-gospel style, Crowder sings about what they mean to him.
