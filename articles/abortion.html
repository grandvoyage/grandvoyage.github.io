		<h1>Abortion Statistics</h1>

        <p>
          There's more we need to do - don't think I'm forgetting the mothers (or pregnant individuals, even).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We need so much more respect for the God-given dignity of women in our culture. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We need a culture of awareness about not only the physical but the emotional dangers of extramarital sex. There should not be a sense of pressure, like this is "given" in dating.
        </p>

        <p>
          We need choices for pregnant people, ironically - our culture focuses so much on abortion as a solution that many women are left with no other choice than one that employs death.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not to make you feel guilty - I believe many people who have advocated for abortion have done so with good intentions.
        </p>

        <p>
          But here's some of what we know:
        </p>

        <p>
          The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion research center, in 2004 found the overwhelming reason for abortions was that the woman did not feel they could take care of themselves, the baby, or their other children - 
          <br>
          <span style="font-size: 300%">60%</span> of the reasons given for abortion suggest an otherwise desire to have the baby, and even the remaining reasons leave a possibility that the child was wanted

        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 300%">620,327</span> abortions for 2020 were reported to the CDC from 49 reporting areas (California, Maryland, and New Hampshire did not report)

        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 300%">1%</span> of women seeking abortions become pregnant through rape
          <br>
          <span style="font-size: 300%"> < 0.5% </span> become pregnant through incest

          The Guttmacher Institute predicts that roughly
          <br>
          <span style="font-size: 300%">1 in 5 women</span>
          <br>
          will have an abortion by 45

          <span style="font-size: 300%">20% of pregnancies</span>
          <br>
          were aborted in the US in 2020

        <p>
          Women are facing overwhelming circumstances. It's unconscionable to resort to terminating human life, but we MUST help these women, too.
