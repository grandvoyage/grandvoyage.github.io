      <h1>Praying for Wisdom and Peace</h1>
      <p>
				Two special things that the Bible is very clear about are wisdom and peace. You're strongly encouraged to ask for these things - the verses almost sound like God is <em>waiting</em> for you to.
			</p>
      <h3>Wisdom</h3>
			<p>
				Here's one of the places where the Bible talks about asking for wisdom, along with some good advice for prayer in general.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking. But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind. Such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. Their loyalty is divided between God and the world, and they are unstable in everything they do. (James 1 1:5-8)
      </blockquote>
			<p>
        This doesn't necessarily mean God never grants prayers to people who aren't totally sure about him yet, because that's not beyond him. But the most powerful prayers are those that are powered by tremendous faith. Jesus said that even faith the size of a tiny mustard seed could move a mountain by prayer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't prioritize the world - the world is the material things and the fads of today. God is eternal, and his ways are far above and beyond the crooked ways of our society.
      </p>
      <h3>Peace</h3>	
			<p>
				You want to feel something amazing? Try asking for peace.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				The Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:5-7)
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Personally, I've had some pretty debilitating fears I've had to face, and one of the greatest lessons I've grown the most from in the last year is to ask for peace. Suddenly, things I would be freaking out about for a month prior to facing a situation are no longer a concern. I just keep asking for peace when I need it, and God doesn't disappoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        He never does.
