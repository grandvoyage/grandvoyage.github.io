			<h1>How to Pray</h1>
			<h3>How to Speak</h3>
			<p>
				Would you believe me if I told you that the Bible is clearer on how to speak to God than most How-To books are about their whole subjects? And in just a few sentences, too.
			</p>
			<p>
				A friend told me, "I don't think I even remember how to pray anymore," which made me think to myself, "Wait, how did I learn to pray??"
			</p>
			<p>
				Once I started thinking about it, I remembered two very excellent verses from the Bible. These verses are so clear and helpful, I am convinced that you'll be able to pray by the time you are done reading this page. Yes, they're that good.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's what I mean. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is asked by his disciples how they can pray.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				"One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."
			</blockquote>
			
			<blockquote>
				He said to them, "When you pray, say:
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				"'Father
				hallowed be your name,
				your kingdom come.
				Give us each day our daily bread.
				Forgive us our sins,
					for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.
				And lead us not into temptation.'" (Luke 11:1-4)
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				A closer transcription of what is now known as the Our Father prayer is found in Matthew, but both contain the full sentiment of how prayer should be; thankful/praising, repentant, and asking. It really isn't the words that matter. God wants you to talk to him.
			</p>	
			<p>
				Why?
			</p>
			<p>
				Because we're working on a relationship with God, and it's awful hard to have a relationship without communication!
			</p>
			<p>
				"But wait," you say in exasperation, "how do I talk to someone I can't see or hear?"
			</p>
			<p>
				Talking to God can be daunting, but today's second verse addresses this.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God. (Romans 8:26-27 - fantastic book)
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Can you see why I am so particularly fond of the Holy Spirit? This verse basically boils down to the idea that God knows what you're asking for, even if you don't know how to say it. Better yet, he knows what you need. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				How To Listen
			</h3>
			<p>
				Usually, the harder part of prayer is listening. (But I mean, isn't that the harder part of human to human communciation too??) I've found that you really have to be ready to listen, and open to anything he might say, to get the listening side of it down. God will sometimes answer questions, sometimes he won't, or you'll have to wait for the answer. Quite often he will send you instant reassurances when you talk to him.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my experience, I've seen this through my enviroment (especially sunsets and rain for me), certain songs on the radio, certain words my eyes fall on when I'm driving. It can be very subtle, so that's why you've got to be on the alert for it. This doesn't always happen; when you shout for an answer to where you should attend college or which job offer you should take, you might not hear anything back immediately. But if you ask a question, I think it will almost always be answered eventually. The Bible promises, explicitly and in multiple places, he's heard you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Prayer is divine conversation, and one of the most powerful actions you can take in any situation. God is always listening, and nothing is too small to talk about. No matter where you are in your prayer life, there's never a bad moment to thank God for always being nearby and ready to listen.
