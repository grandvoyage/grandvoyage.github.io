		<h1>Receiving the Holy Spirit</h1>
		<p>
			So how can a person receive the Holy Spirit? It turns out, I already had the Holy Spirit that day I "met" him in junior year. This is not necessarily the only way that the Holy Spirit may come to a person, but when you believe and receive Jesus as your savior, the Holy Spirit becomes a part of you, according to Ephesians 1:13-14:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago. The Spirit is God's guarantee that he will give us the inheritance he promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people. He did this so we would praise and glorify him. (Ephesians 1:13-14)
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The Spirit grows within you, as I learned in 11th grade, but if you believe, he is already with you!
