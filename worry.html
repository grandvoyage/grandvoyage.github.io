		<h1>My Comprehensive Plan for the Total Cessation of Worry:</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>First</strong> "cast some anxieties" on God. Some good examples of how to do this are to say "God give me the right words to say to my friend when I apologize to her." or "God help me make the right choice between these two amazing job opportunities." Sometimes God's will doesn't match up with your prayer (Jesus asked that he could avoid the cross if God could have it any other way, but it had to be) but as long as you are ready to cede to his higher wisdom if necessary, you will often find that he will move some mountains for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Second</strong> see the result and trust God more. Now that you've seen him in action, remember to acknowledge that he intervened - this is how your trust in him grows and you are empowered to give him bigger anxieties next time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Third</strong> give God more cares. This doesn't mean you can stop doing things and just have God do everything for you, but you'd be shocked how much guidance or even sometimes intervention he'll give you if you ask for it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Fourth</strong> say thanks, trust God more.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Fifth</strong> more worries into God's hands!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Sixth</strong> more trust!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Seventh</strong> this is obviously a pattern!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Eighth</strong> I'm going to stop writing repetitive steps now!
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually you become so trusting in God that you are a super chill dude or dudette.
		</p>
		<p>
			The world will criticize you for not worrying. Because if you aren't worrying you must not be taking this seriously. Two points: 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They're wrong. Ignore them.</li> 
			<li>Given the grand scheme of things, I bet you what it is they're worrying about really isn't worth taking so seriously.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Update: Since I wrote this, I have been trying to live it out as literally as possible - and it's been a lot of fun! Uncertainties have become just one more opportunity to grow, instead of something to worry about. Not bad.
