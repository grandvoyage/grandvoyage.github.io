	<h1>Jesus, Friend to All</h1>
		<h3>He was honest at the risk of his popularity (and life).</h3>
		<p>
			We know that Jesus loved even the Pharisees and elders, because he prayed for them even after they had him nailed to the cross, but he was brutally honest to them. If he'd wanted, he could have been vastly more popular by leaving out some of the things he said, but instead he told the truth out of love. This makes me trust him.
		</p>
		<h3>He cared about people.</h3>
		<p>
			There's a story at Luke 7:11 that says Jesus was moved with compassion for a widow carrying her dead son out of the city Jesus was entering. He turned to her, in spite of the large crowd around him, and said to her, "Don't cry." I can picture in my mind a look of pain and concern on his face as he says this, stopped in the middle of what he was doing, before bringing her son back to life.
		</p>	
		<h3>He saw the value in everyone. And he noticed everyone.</h3>
		<p>
			Jesus didn't overlook anyone. He came to the aid of an adultress, he spent a great deal of time teaching women, many of whom were valued friends of his, and he ate with tax collectors. All of these were people who were nothing in society at that time, but Jesus saw them and gave them a chance.
		</p>
		<h3> He made sure his friends were taken good care of after he left. </h3>
		<p>
			After his resurrection, Jesus came back and spent more time with his friends (imagine getting to spend that extra time with someone you thought you'd lost), but eventually he had to go back to Heaven. But he didn't leave his friends all alone.
