			<h1>Day 5: You Have Incredible Purpose</h1>
			<p>
				It may seem like all of this is easy for me to say, because it may seem like I'm just lucky enough to be flawless. I will tell you right now - I am a sinner. Like anyone, there are things that I have done and still sometimes do that I am ashamed of. If I can learn the things I've learned and manage to follow these principles inasmuch as I've already succeeded, you can too. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I've come a long way since high school. In high school my relationship with myself was very bad. I was my least favorite person. I was trapped in my own anger over the mistakes that I'd made. And then God said something to me, and I want you to know that he is saying it to you as well.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				You are important to me. I have a purpose for you.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				In that moment, everything changed. Today I am able to look myself in the eye and be proud of who I am and how far I've come, and it all started when I realized that I had a purpose.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, <br>
				before you were born I set you apart; <br>
				I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. (Jeremiah 1:5)
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Do you have dreams? I'm sure you do. Some dreams are big, and some dreams are small, and some are the really awesome ones that you keep in a velvety box on a snazzy pedestal in a special room in your soul. ...Doesn't everyone do that?
			</p>
			<p>
				God made you for something incredibly special, and the best part of it (in my opinion) is that that special purpose is something you're going to love! Some of your dreams are dreams that you are made to live out and you have them because God made you with them. You came preinstalled with dreams.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your dream might be extravagant, like walking on the moon, or it might be as simple as being a great parent. The truth is, whether your dream seems big or small, every God-given dream is essential in His eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				So go ahead, you're stuck - you're going to have to accept that you were made for greatness. These are the hard truths.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now maybe, just maybe, a little voice in your head mumbled, "I can't do that." Not without Jesus, perhaps, but with his help, you can fulfill your purpose and do so much more! Here's one of my very favorite Bible verses, and one of the easiest to memorize.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. (Philippians 4:13)
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Because you were made with a purpose, you are necessary. You are essential! The world would not be the same without you, and even if you forsook your calling and someone else stepped into that role, no one could do it as well as you. 
			</p>
			<p>
				4:13 doesn't mean that you'll succeed at absolutely everything you attempt. (You'd understand this if you watched me play basketball.) Everyone still experiences failures and struggles. But what it <em>does</em> mean is that you will live a satisfying, interesting, and impactful life if you stick with God. I cannot wait to see what you will do.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am so glad you came along for this journey; I hope you are too. I hope that you are looking at yourself in a whole new light - as a child of God, a beloved brother or sister of Jesus, and a treasure chest where the Holy Spirit can reside. It's not too crazy to believe, it's your real life (okay, maybe your life IS crazy, but now you know it's crazy and fantastically awesome). Go out there and live it to the full, with God right by your side.
			</p>

				It's only fitting that since I started with a favorite song, that happens to be by Matt Maher, I end with another favorite that also happens to be by Matt Maher. I absolutely cannot get enough of this one.
