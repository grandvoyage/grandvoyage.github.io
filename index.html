		<h1>5 Day Faith Challenge</h1>
		<h3>
			Welcome
		</h3>
		<p>
			Over the course of this challenge, it is my goal to help you build a personal relationship with God. You will not be talked down to, preached at, or bored into submission. I make use of Bible verses in these entries not to throw Bible verses at you or to make myself feel good for actually knowing Bible verses (Google is very helpful, I'll be honest), but to give you the opportunity to analyze God's own words about himself. There's an idea that Christianity is based entirely on a concept of mindlessly believing everything you are told, but we are not going to buy into that. Jesus told his disciples the greatest commandment: 
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Jesus replied: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'" (Matthew 22:37)
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Jesus himself is widely considered, even secularly, to be one of the wisest men to ever walk the earth, so it is no surprise that we can pursue him intellectually! Eventually, we will run into things that we simply cannot understand fully, and will have to cede them to the heart and soul, but for now, the mind is a perfectly acceptable place to start.
