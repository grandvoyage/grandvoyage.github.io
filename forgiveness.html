			<h1>Day 3: God is patient. Sooo patient.</h1>
			<p>
				Let's be honest. I'm sure you've had this feeling too; sometimes when I've done things that are totally wrong, once I see it all clearly, the first thing I do is wait for the lightning bolt. Bam, a Kevin-shaped crater in the ground. And over and over, I've been flat out wrong. (Instead of a flat-out crater.) The question I've asked is, why would God forgive me so many times? 
			</p>
			<p>
				God is the friend you want in life, because <em>God still believes in you</em>. When I struggled with my shortcomings, he believed in me long after I had stopped believing in me.
			</p>
			<p>
				So how many times will God forgive you? We're going to do the sensible thing and solve this with code.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jesus said "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." (John 14:6), so we'll take him at his Word and we'll create a variable called "Jesus" and set it to true.<br>
				Next we'll create an list of promises, so-named. 
			</p>
			<pre>
import random
Jesus = True
God_promises = ["If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:19)", "You are forgiven!", "I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more. (Isaiah 43:25-26)", '"Come now, let us settle the matter," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool." (Isaiah 1:18)', " Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!  (2 Cor 5:17)", "In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace (Ephesians 1:7)"]

while Jesus:
  you_are_not = random.choice(God_promises);
  # it is in
  print(you_are_not + "\n")
			</pre>
			<p>
				Go ahead, copy it into a Python compiler online and see what it does. The compiler might give up and quit, but God won't!
			</p>
			<p>
				I should note that there are a couple of things you need to remember; first that you have to forgive others as you were forgiven. Which is totally fair, really. Hard, because you might not love that trespasser as much as God loves you, but it's worth it.
			</p>	
			<p>
				Also, you have to repent about your sins. If you're real with yourself, and you're truly attempting to be the best you can be, I'm not worried about you. The right attitude comes with time, but the Holy Spirit will guide you to make the right apologies to God and work on the right improvements.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my code poem, I noted to you that you are not a random choice; here's what Jesus says about you when you turn away from God.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				"What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish." (Matthew 18:12-14)
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The great thing here is that God doesn't have to leave the non-lost sheep because he's everywhere! But still, even if God had 99 people who were 100% committed to him, even 99999, as many as you want, he would not be satisfied without you. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Too long for here, but in a few lines you can read for yourself the story of the prodigal son, who treats his father like he's dead (asks for his inheritance), blows half the family fortune on prostitutes and booze, and doesn't call home even once, AND THEN COMES HOME. What does his father do? Welcomes him back, no questions asked. That's what God is like. (Luke 15:11-32)
			</p>
			<p>
				We know from Day 1 (of this Challenge, not like Day 1 of your life, that would be impressive) that Jesus' death on the cross made it possible for everyone to enter Heaven and have forgiveness of their sins. He knew what he was going to experience, and he went to the cross anyway. But even if it was only to forgive your sins, even if you were the only person who ever decided to follow him, Jesus would have still died to save you, even only you. You are valuable beyond measure to God, even deemed worth God himself dying for.

				Come on back tomorrow; we're going to delve into God's stated plans for your life. It's really good stuff, too - tomorrow's exploration takes us through some of my absolute favorite Bible verses.
			</p>

				Walk tall today; you are loved!
