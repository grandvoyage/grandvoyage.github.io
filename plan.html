			<h1>Day 4: God Has a Plan for You</h1>
			<p>
				There's a sort of stereotype that the Bible is full of rules, but this is a view that comes from not understanding what the Bible is really about. I think of a rule as something you break and get punished for. But as you read yesterday, Jesus died on the cross so that we could be saved from the punishment for our sins (if we accept him in that role). So we have things we're told to do and not to do, but we're also saved when we break them.
			</p>
			<p>
				SO THERE ARE NO RULES?!?
			</p>
			<p>
				Calm down.
			</p>
			<p>
				God gives us instruction and moral "barriers", if you will, to help us stay in a right relationship with him and ourselves. The definition of sin I always learned in Catholic school was "something that harms one's relationship with God". So there really are some things you should and shouldn't do. Yeah, I know, it kind of brings back the rules, but not because we have to fear going to Hell if we don't follow them. Our discussion of the rules actually brings us to two of my favorite Bible verses of all.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. (John 10:10)
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				So how can giving up things make your life fuller? <em>Because God is guiding you to live the life you were made for.</em> God's intention is that you do awesome things in your life and in the process not only serve him and others, but yourself as well, as you grow and experience things.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sins are what come between you and what God wants for you. Lying about others, drugs, drunkenness, lust, living together outside of marriage, jealousy, and vengefulness are all things that separate you from your "optimized" life. God wants you to have the most joy, make the most impact, and be the most you.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				"For I know the plans I have for you," says the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." (Jeremiah 29:11)
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				What if you think you're sinning right now in your life? What if you don't even know where to start to get rid of some of the things you're doing? Don't wait to have everything in order; go to God right now.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let me say that again in a different font.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family:'Fredericka the Great',monospace; font-size:150%;">
				Don't wait to have everything in order; go to God right now.
			</p>
			<p>
				God loves you right now, already - bumps, bruises, and all. I didn't list those things to make you feel shame, but to perhaps show you things in your life that aren't worthy of you.
			</p>
			<p>
				You should work to improve yourself, sure, but there are two very important things to remember when doing so. 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Be patient with yourself - if you're trying, you're probably making some progress, even if it isn't as fast as you'd like. </li>
				<li>Self-improvement is always better and easier WITH God.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				God's plans for you are perfect - they're the best thing you could ask for in life. He made you, he knows you better than anyone else, and he will bring you to the greatest adventures you could ask for if you do your best to let him lead.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, <br>
				neither are your ways my ways," <br>
				declares the Lord. <br>
 
				"As the heavens are higher than the earth, <br>
				so are my ways higher than your ways <br>
				and my thoughts than your thoughts." (Isaiah 55:8-9)
			</blockquote>
