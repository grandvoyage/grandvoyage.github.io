		<h1>Welcome, Friends</h1>
		<p>
			If you have this link, I wrote this website for you, someone I know personally. I started work on this site months ago, with this phrase in mind.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Everyone deserves something worth believing in.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			And while believing in yourself is a good thing to do, I think that a lot can be said for a great, personal relationship with God. You have contributed happiness to my life through my knowing you, and I want to give back to you by offering my own insight into the person of God. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I've worked meticulously on this website, agonizing over nearly every word until I thought it was something worth reading. No matter if you're a believer in Jesus, a total atheist, an agnostic, or even a follower of a different faith altogether, I think you have something to gain by reading one article each day for five days.
		</p>

			Give this a shot - feel free to message me if you have questions and share the site with whoever you want.
