		<h1>Day 2: God makes it personal</h1>
		<p>
			My faith life got far more personal during college. In Catholic high school, I had spent a lot of time thinking about God, but there were a lot of people in between me and him: priests, parents, teachers, all sorts of folks. But at college it was all me and him; and my college was like education by fire sometimes. But you know what's amazing is that God wants to hear our thoughts. All our thoughts. I used to think that God was busy, you know making planets and inventing pizza and stuff (China and Italy are taking credit for pizza but I think we all know that that was divine inspiration). So I didn't think he wanted to hear the silly little things running through my head, just the big stuff. <br>
			But 1 Peter says: 
		</p>
			<blockquote>Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. (1 Peter 5:7)</blockquote>
		<p>
			I've learned that this goes even further than anxieties. God wants to hear my thoughts. So I've learned to talk to him, and I try to listen to what he says back too. He wants to be there when you're struggling, but he wants to share in your joy. He is with you the whole time. "So bring your good times, and your laughter too!" That wasn't from the Bible, that was the song Celebration. Classic.
		</p>
		<p>
			This may sound absurd to you, that an all-powerful being wants to hang out with you - constantly! - but listen to what Jesus told his disciples about God's presence in your life:
		</p>
			<blockquote>Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?... But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. (Matthew 6:25)</blockquote>
		<p>
			So Jesus is saying that if we serve him and strive for goodness, God will give us everything we need.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jesus says we can stop worrying - can we?? It's not like someone has  <a href="worry.html">a comprehensive plan for the total cessation of worry</a>.
		<p>
			We can. It just takes practice. But until we're totally trusting in God for everything (I'm still a ways from that too, don't worry) we can use this section of Matthew for a second purpose - we can have our minds blown by the fact that God wants to provide for us down to those little details!
		</p>
		<p>
			I think one of the most stunning verses in the Bible would be this one from Psalms: 
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book. (Psalms 56:8) 
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			I'd never heard that one until I watched the movie The Shack (highly recommended), in which the Holy Spirit helps the main character start new life in his soul by watering it with the tears God collected from his suffering. God is never far away from you, most of all when you are in need of him. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There were days at college I just wanted to cry. On one particular occasion, I was in my room feeling perfectly miserable about a certain disastrous presentation of a game (the playable characters duplicated themselves and turned into ghosts during the presentation - none of that was planned or desirable), when I noticed that there was a gorgeous sunset starting up right out my window. As I watched the sunset blossomed up into a  fire across the sky and when it was done, it was as if it sucked the sad right out of me. God has always been very good to me. He cheers me when I am sad by sunsets, checkmark-shaped clouds, or just raining on me (I love rain).
		</p>
		<p>
			So go ahead, talk to God. Listen too. The first step in changing your life for the better is to go into business with the right partner, and you'll never find a partner more dedicated to you.
